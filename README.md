# my-vite-app

## Introduction
This is a step-by-step guide on how to create your own Vite app and host it with GitHub Pages.  
This guide uses the [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy) and builds off of it. 
This guide is intended for beginners so we will go into more detail and offer corrections that are needed at the time of this writing.

## Installation  
Make sure you have a GitHub account set up on https://github.com/
Make sure you have GitHub Desktop installed from https://desktop.github.com/
Make sure you have current Node.js installed from https://nodejs.org/en  
Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Setup  
### GitHub
Open [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
Create a new repository by clicking on the button that says "New".  
Name it "my-vite-app" or any name you prefer.  

Open GitHub Desktop.  
Clone your new repository. You can do this by going to the top-left and clicking File > Clone Repository. Open the GitHub.com tab and search for the name of your repository. Click on it and decide your local path. I recommend using a path such as: /Developer/githubusername/my-vite-app. But your local path can be anything you'd like.  
Now your GitHub workflow is connected! You should see a "Open in Visual Studio Code" button. Go ahead and click that.  

### Vite  
Now it's time to create your vite app.  
With your Visual Studio Code open, click on Terminal > New Terminal and run the command:  
> npm create vite@latest

type y to install the necessary packages  
It will ask you to name the project. I will name mine ["homer"](https://media1.tenor.com/m/tvjuVcJxIk0AAAAC/skinny-homer-homer-back-fat.gif).  
Project name: homer   
Framework: React  
Variant: TypeScript
